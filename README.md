# javascript-capstone project. Hangman Game.

This is a mobile friendly game of hang-man. Users get a few changes to guess the right letter. Users are given clues to guess the word. See it live at https://marioborras.github.io/javascript-capstone/

This project was done after a few weeks of learning the basics of JavaScript. I often come back here to refactor the code.
